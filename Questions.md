How to upload the full dataset onto github.  
The dataset has only 3d models. Do you think we are capable of handling at least one of these 6 tasks. 


Phototourism and historical preservation: different viewpoints, sensor types, time of day/year, and occlusions. Ancient historical sites add a unique set of challenges

Night vs day and temporal changes: combination of day and night photographs, including poor lighting, or photographs taken months or years apart, in different weather

Aerial and mixed aerial-ground: images from drones, featuring arbitrary in-plane rotations, matched against similar images and also images taken from the ground

Repeated structures: symmetrical objects require details to disambiguate perspective

Natural environments: highly non-regular structures such as trees and foliage

Transparencies and reflections: objects like glassware are lacking in texture and create reflections and specularities which pose a different set of problems
