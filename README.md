# COSC 410 Final Project: 2-D Reconstruction from Unstructured Image Collections

## Project Overview

This project focuses on using machine learning algorithms to accurately reconstruct 2-D scenes from unstructured collections of images. Such reconstructions are vital for various applications like virtual tourism, urban planning, autonomous navigation, and historical preservation. Our team aims to tackle the question: "How can machine learning algorithms be effectively utilized to generate accurate 2-D reconstructions from unstructured collections of images?" We will be participating in the Kaggle Image Matching Challenge 2024 to apply and test our methodologies.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to improve various real-world applications through enhanced 2-D reconstructions. These include creating more immersive photo tourism experiences, aiding in the preservation of historical sites, solving the challenges of navigating through repetitive structures, integrating complex natural environments into reconstructions, and accurately representing transparent and reflective surfaces.

## Dataset

We will use the dataset provided by the [Kaggle Image Matching Challenge 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/image-matching-challenge-2024/data), which consists of a wide range of images to test our algorithms for accuracy and efficiency in 2-D reconstruction.

## Methodology

- **Model Creation**: Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image analysis and feature extraction.
- **Model Testing and Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using the mean Average Accuracy (mAA) of the registered camera centers, with detailed criteria provided by the Kaggle competition.
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning and preparing the image data for optimal model training and testing.
